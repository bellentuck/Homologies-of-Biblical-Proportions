put to shame them that are wise and God chose the weak things of the world that he might put to shame the things that are strong                                                                    and the base things of the world and the things that are despised did God choose yea and the things that are not that he might bring to nought the things that are                                                                    that no flesh should glory before God                                                                    But of him are ye in Christ Jesus who was made unto us wisdom from God

the husband hath not power over his own body but the wife                                                                    Defraud ye not one the other except it be by consent for a season that ye may give yourselves unto prayer and may be together again that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency                                                                    But this I say by way of concession not of commandment                                                                    Yet I would that all men were even as I myself Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God one after

the Lord hath distributed to each man as God hath called each so let him walk And so ordain I in all the churches                                                                    Was any man called

nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of God                                                                    Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was

                                          For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lords freedman likewise he that was called being free is Christs bondservant                                                                    Ye were bought with a price become not bondservants of men                                                                    Brethren let each man wherein he was called therein abide with God                                                                    Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord but I give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy                                                                    I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us namely that it is good for a man to be as he is                                                                    Art thou bound unto a wife Seek not to be loosed Art thou loosed from a wife Seek not

flesh and I would spare you                                                                    But this I say brethren the time is shortened that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none                                                                    and those that weep as though they wept not and those that rejoice as though they rejoiced not and those that buy as though they possessed not                                                                    and those that use the world as not using it to the full for the fashion of this world passeth away                                                                    But I would have you to be free from cares He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord how he may please the Lord                                                                    but he that is married is careful for the things of the world how he may please his wife                                                                    and is divided So also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married is careful for the things of the world how she may please her husband                                                                    And this I say for your own profit not that I may cast a snare upon you but for that which is seemly and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction                                                                    But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin daughter if she be past the flower of her age and if need so requireth let him do what he will he sinneth not let them marry                                                                    But he that standeth stedfast in his heart having no necessity but hath power as touching in his own heart to keep his own virgin daughter shall do well                                                                    So then both he that giveth his own virgin daughter in marriage doeth well and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better                                                                    A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth but if the husband be dead she is free to be married to whom she will only in the Lord                                                                    But she is happier if she abide as she is after my judgment and I think that I also have the Spirit of God                                ',\n",
